NASAâ€™s website was scraped Using Chromedriver and Beautiful Soup. What was scraped was the latest news regarding Mars, as well as the latest featured satellite image. All of this was encapsulated in our own website that is on display. Use the following link to access it: https://valla101.github.io/web_scraping_challenge/
